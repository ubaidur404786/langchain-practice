    "### 🕵️‍♂️ Agent Execution Trace: Step-by-Step Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we executed the agent using the query:\n",
    "\n",
    "> _\"Find the capital of France, then find its current weather condition\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are using the **LangChain v1.x `create_agent`** factory, the model followed a **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)** loop. Below is the breakdown of what happened \"under the hood\" during the execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔄 The Reasoning Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Thought (Reasoning)**: The LLM (Mistral) analyzed the prompt and determined it needed two pieces of external information: the capital of France and the current weather for that specific city.\n",
    "2.  **Action 1 (Tool Call)**: The agent invoked `duckduckgo_search` with the query `\"Capital of France\"`.\n",
    "3.  **Observation 1 (Result)**: The search tool returned a block of text confirming that **Paris** is the capital.\n",
    "4.  **Action 2 (Tool Call)**: Having identified the city, the agent immediately moved to the next logical step and invoked `get_weather_data` with the argument `city=\"Paris\"`.\n",
    "5.  **Observation 2 (Result)**: The weather tool returned: `\"The current weather in Paris is Overcast. Temperature: 2°C (Feels like -3°C).\"`\n",
    "6.  **Final Response**: The agent synthesized these observations into a natural language response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📊 Execution Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen in the raw result object, the agent successfully managed multiple tool calls in a single run:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model**: `mistral` (via Ollama)\n",
    "- **Tokens Used**: ~569 Total Tokens\n",
    "- **Tool Sequence**: `duckduckgo_search` ➔ `get_weather_data`\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates the power of **Agentic AI**: the model didn't just give a static answer; it dynamically decided which tools to use, in what order, and how to handle the data they returned.\n"

In France, the taxation of capital gains (plus-value) from the sale of works of art such as paintings by deceased artists (typically handled by heirs) in 2025-2026 follows the standard regime for movable property with no specific exemptions or major changes introduced for these years (proposals to integrate artworks into wealth tax were rejected). The two main options are: the forfaitaire regime (most common), which applies a flat tax of 6.5% (6% tax + 0.5% CRDS) on the full sale price if it exceeds €5,000, regardless of any actual gain or loss; or the irrevocable real regime (elected via form no. 2092 within one month of the sale), where the capital gain (sale price minus acquisition price or market value declared at succession) is taxed at 19% income tax plus 17.2% social levies for a total of 36.2%, with a holding period abatement of 5% per year beyond the second year leading to full exemption after 22 years. The acquisition price is generally the value declared during the succession process. While searching our database we found 1 possible solution for the: Capital of France crossword clue.
